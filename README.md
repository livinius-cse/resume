Hello! I'm Livinius Christy Raj, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at LICET, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree (2024–2028). I have a growing interest in web development and embedded systems, and I love blending technology with creativity to build meaningful digital experiences.

I’ve worked on projects like a personal resume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and an IoT-based agriculture sensor system aimed at improving smart farming. I'm continuously learning and enjoy experimenting with code.

Beyond tech, I’m an active sports enthusiast who enjoys Handball, Cricket, Carrom, and Volleyball. I believe in maintaining a balanced life where teamwork, discipline, and persistence apply both on the field and in code.
